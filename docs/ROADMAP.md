# Agent Studio Roadmap

This roadmap keeps the project aligned with the current goal:

```text
Build a portfolio-grade Agent Runtime Studio that demonstrates real backend capability through a polished /agent workspace.
```

The priority is not enterprise launch readiness yet. The priority is a credible product demo for job search and portfolio review.

## Roadmap Principles

- `/agent` is the product center.
- Chat is the primary surface.
- Runtime Graph explains dependencies.
- Timeline debugs execution.
- Inspector explains the selected runtime object.
- Backend features should be used when they already exist.
- Enterprise platform features are planned, but not allowed to distract from the portfolio demo.

## Current Backend Readiness

The current backend is sufficient for the portfolio demo.

Available runtime capabilities:

- Agent
- Planner
- WorkflowRunner
- ToolExecutor
- ToolRegistry
- RAG
- MemoryManager
- Reflection
- Evaluation
- Observability
- EventTrace
- TaskManager
- Retry
- Cancel
- Server-Sent Events

Demo task:

```text
分析华东销售下降原因，并生成报告
```

Expected demo flow:

```text
User Task
  -> Planner
  -> Tool
  -> Knowledge
  -> Memory
  -> Reflection
  -> Evaluation
  -> Answer
```

- Added Timeline trace summary with trace id, root span, span count, event count, duration, and critical path.
- Added UI-level SSE demo pacing with `VITE_AGENT_DEMO_PACING=false` opt-out.
- Added RuntimeObject architecture documentation.

Acceptance:

- Selecting any runtime object updates Graph, Timeline, Inspector, Drawer, and Chat evidence consistently.
- Timeline reads like a trace system, not an event list.
- Inspector content changes meaningfully by runtime object type.

## Phase 3: Dashboard Productization

Goal:

Turn Dashboard from placeholder into a runtime overview page.

Scope:

Historical specification: `docs/archive/phases/PHASE3_DASHBOARD.md`

- Recent Tasks
- Recent Failures
- Average Evaluation
- Runtime Metrics
- Model Usage
- Latest Memory
- Recent Knowledge
- Cost
- Latency

Acceptance:

- Dashboard helps explain recent runtime activity.
- Dashboard does not compete with `/agent` as the primary product entry.

## Phase 4: Knowledge Platform

## Version Mapping

```text
Agent Studio 2.0
  Phase 1: Agent Workspace Industry Demo
  Phase 2: Runtime Deepening

Agent Studio 2.1
  Phase 4: Knowledge Platform

Agent Studio 2.2
  Phase 5: Memory Platform

Agent Studio 2.3
  Phase 6: Evaluation Platform

Agent Studio 2.4
  Phase 7: Workflow Builder

Agent Studio 3.0
  Phase 8: Enterprise Platform
```

Dashboard productization can ship between 2.0 and 2.1, but it must not replace `/agent` as the default product experience.

- Better failed and cancelled states
- Demo playback pacing
- Export/share run summary
- Dashboard productization

### P2: Must Finish Before Product Platform

- Knowledge Center
- Memory Center

- Workflow Builder
- Cross-page evidence navigation
- Run comparison

### P3: Later Enterprise Readiness

- RBAC

## What Not To Do Now

Do not spend the next phase on:

- Enterprise security
- Billing
- Team management
- Marketing pages
- Broad dashboard widgets
- Low-code workflow authoring

These are important, but they do not improve the current job-search demo as much as making `/agent` exceptional.
