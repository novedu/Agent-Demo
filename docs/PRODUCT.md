# Agent Studio Product Specification

Version: 2.0

---

# Product Positioning

Agent Studio is an enterprise platform for **building, running, observing, debugging, and evaluating AI agent systems**.

Unlike traditional AI chat applications, Agent Studio is designed for engineers who need complete visibility into an agent runtime.

It provides a unified engineering workspace for understanding:

- what an agent planned
- how it executed
- which tools it used
- what knowledge it retrieved
- how memory evolved
- why a decision was made
- whether the final answer is trustworthy

Agent Studio is **runtime-first**, not chat-first.

---

# Product Vision

Modern AI applications require far more than a conversational interface.

Developers need to understand the complete runtime lifecycle of an AI agent:

Planning → Execution → Knowledge Retrieval → Memory → Reflection → Evaluation

Agent Studio provides a single engineering workspace where every runtime decision is observable, explainable, and debuggable.

The long-term vision is to become the operating system for AI agent engineering.

# Design Principles

Every feature must follow these principles.

## Runtime First

The runtime is the product.

Everything else exists to explain the runtime.

---

## Explainability over Decoration

Visual polish should never hide engineering information.

Every UI element should help explain how the runtime behaves.

---

## Evidence Driven

Every important conclusion should be backed by evidence.

Evidence includes:

- Knowledge
- Citation
- Memory
- Trace
- Logs
- Evaluation

---

## Progressive Disclosure

Show only the information needed at the current moment.

Reveal deeper runtime details only when requested.

---

## One Runtime Context

The entire workspace revolves around a single runtime object.

Every component should describe the same object from different perspectives.

---

# Core Product Pillars

Agent Studio focuses on four engineering capabilities.

## Planning

Understand how goals become executable plans.

Includes:

- Goal
- Planner
- Plan
- Step
- Dependencies

---

## Execution

Observe how the runtime executes.

Includes:

- Workflow
- Tool Calls
- Runtime State
- Progress
- Output

---

## Evidence

Understand why the runtime produced the result.

Includes:

- Knowledge Retrieval
- Citation
- Memory
- Trace
- Logs
- Runtime Relationships

---

## Evaluation

Measure runtime quality.

Includes:

- Accuracy
- Groundedness
- Task Completion
- Completeness
- Latency
- Cost

---

# Runtime Lifecycle

Every task follows a predictable runtime lifecycle.

# Runtime Object Model

Every engineering artifact is represented as a Runtime Object.

Supported runtime objects include:

- Planner
- Workflow
- Tool
- Knowledge
- Memory
- Reflection
- Evaluation
- Answer
- Trace
- Log

All major UI components consume the same runtime object.

This guarantees consistency across:

- Runtime Graph
- Timeline
- Inspector
- Drawer
- Evidence
- Logs

---

# Product Rule

Every screen must allow users to answer these questions within **three seconds**.

- What is the agent doing?
- Which step is currently running?
- Why is it doing this?
- Has anything failed?
- What evidence supports this answer?
- What should I do next?

If the interface cannot answer these questions, the design has failed.

# Information Architecture

Default route:

Agent Workspace is always the primary entry.

Dashboard is an overview page, not the main experience.

# Non Goals

Agent Studio is not:

- a chatbot product
- a workflow automation platform
- a low-code platform
- a business dashboard
- a reporting system
- a consumer AI assistant

These capabilities are intentionally out of scope.

# Success Metrics

A successful Agent Studio enables engineers to:

- understand runtime state within three seconds
- locate failures within thirty seconds
- inspect evidence without leaving the workspace
- debug failed tasks in a single workflow
- evaluate answer quality immediately after execution
- iterate rapidly with confidence

Success is measured by engineering efficiency rather than conversational quality.
